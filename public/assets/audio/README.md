# Audio

This folder is for your background music file.

I did **not** download any music automatically (license uncertainty). Two safe options:

1) Add your own track (recommended)
- Place `bg-music.mp3` (and optionally `bg-music.ogg`) here.

2) Generate a simple "romantic tune" in code
- Use WebAudio to synthesize a soft chord progression and gate it behind the Music Toggle.

If you want, tell me whether you prefer (1) or (2) and I can implement the toggle behavior accordingly once the app is scaffolded.
