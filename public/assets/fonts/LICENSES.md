# Font Licenses

These font files were downloaded from Google Fonts and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).

Families included:
- Playfair Display
- Inter

Source CSS:
- https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;600&family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap

Tip: If you later change font weights/styles, re-run the download step so the local `fonts.css` and `.woff2` files stay in sync.
